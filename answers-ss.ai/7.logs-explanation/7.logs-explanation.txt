Log messages play a crucial role in monitoring the status and progress of each container within the system. For the producer container, they are essential for confirming the establishment of a secure connection with the Kafka broker and checking for logs indicating successful message transmissions. In the logs of the 'container-producer,' there was an initial inability to locate a broker, but eventually, logs reporting "Sent message ..." were generated. These logs also serve as a way to observe the retry mechanisms in the application, as they reveal repeated connection attempts following failures. Furthermore, these log details help in confirming both the message count and content, ensuring the accuracy of data processing. Similarly, in the Consumer container, the logs are examined for any errors related to connections with Kafka and other applications. When an error occurs, it can be handled through exceptions and error traceback, as demonstrated in the 'container-consumer' log file. By analyzing the log messages from the applications, Zookeeper, Elasticsearch, and Neo4j, it becomes possible to identify and resolve any issues that may arise during the pipeline's execution. This analysis ensures a seamless data processing and storage system.}
